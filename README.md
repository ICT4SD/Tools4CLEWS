# Tools4CLEWS
Modelling and simulation tools for integrated analysis of the interlinkages between climate, land, materials, energy and water in our planet.

Objective
-------------
This project aims to promote the design of software tools for modelling and simulation of scenarios to see the interactions between climate-change, land usage, and water usage overtime to assist policy planners.
